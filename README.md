This is a from-scratch implementation of the Glicko-2 rating system, which I have run on Starcraft pro tournaments (ASL seasons 0 through 19) to determine the relative strengths of the best Starcraft 1 players today. Feel free to download this project and exchange the data for your own purposes, just change the paths in main. Thank you!

If you are interested in the calculated ELOs for ASL, then I will add the results below, as well as in text form in folder output_ratings
